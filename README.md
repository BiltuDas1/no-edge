# The NO Edge Project
**Please Note: If you used No Edge version 1.0.0.5 or earlier, then you can't use the latest version of noedge, for that you need to [uninstall](https://www.tomsguide.com/how-to/how-to-uninstall-microsoft-edge) and reinstall Edge browser from [Official Source](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge) manually.**

The Project Helps you to remove build-in Edge Browser from Windows and replacing another Browser instead of Edge

NOTE: THE PROJECT BREAKS WINDOWS 10 SEARCH, SO YOU NEED TO [DISABLE WINDOWS 10 BING SEARCH](https://www.howtogeek.com/224159/how-to-disable-bing-in-the-windows-10-start-menu/) BEFORE DOING ANYTHING.
